EvolutionSDK Phar Compiler
==========================
This compiler is one of the easiest ways to get your EvolutionSDK file started. Right now it only compiles the framework. In the future I plan on allowing it to set up a new website for you and or just keep your framework updated.

Usage
=====
Currently the only available argument is which branch of EvolutionSDK to compile. Right now the "dev" branch is the only branch with support for Phar files but this will change within the next couple days.

  ./compile [branch]
  
More on this later.
